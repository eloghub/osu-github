NOTES/CHALLENGES:

+line 31 (HTML) - Missing div id to make screen jump to specific section of webpage when line 17 (HTML) is clicked on

+My primary goal was to make sure all images on the webpage had alt texts and titles
I made this possible through the use of alt attributes(?) in the img tags and with title attributes that I learned from a classmate in breakout rooms.
I also separated img attributes line by line in HTML to make them easier for developers to read

+line 8 (^) -
